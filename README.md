# Graphics 1 Coursework

###Coursework Description
To design and implement your own 2D game using OpenGL and C++. The user should control a vehicle around the 2D 
environment and be viewed from above. 
<br>There must be a clear start and end to the game and the user must navigate their vehicle around a track or route 
with boundaries (e.g. a racetrack with grass verges, a river with banks). 
<br>You may decide on the vehicle and the track but you should incorporate collision detection between your vehicle 
and the boundaries. 
The following features are essential: 
* The game has a clear starting position and the user’s controls should be clearly stated. 
* A clear objective and scoring system needs to be provided. 
* The world should be larger than the screen size which means the background (world) should scroll both horizontally 
and vertically if the user’s vehicle threatens to go off the screen out of the user’s view. 
* A track or path should be defined with clear boundaries for the user to navigate around.
* There should be a response to colliding with the boundaries (e.g. the vehicle bounces off or slows down). 
* There should be at least one other vehicle racing against the user.
* Collisions should be detected between the user and the other vehicles in the environment.
